    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 1 January 2026</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how RapidReviewer (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
        collects and uses information when you use the RapidReviewer Chrome
        extension and the website at <strong>rapidreviewer.io</strong>
        (together, the “Service”).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Information We Collect via the Chrome Extension</h2>
      <p>
        The RapidReviewer Chrome extension is designed to help you log your own
        GitHub pull request activity for performance review and personal
        tracking. When you use the extension, it may collect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A user‑provided API key, which you generate in your RapidReviewer
          account and paste into the extension options. This key is stored
          locally in your browser using Chrome’s
          <code>chrome.storage</code> API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic pull request details that are already visible on GitHub pull
          request pages, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Repository owner and name</li>
            <li>Pull request number and title</li>
            <li>Pull request URL</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          A short summary that you manually type when logging a pull request
          event (for example, describing what you did in that PR or review).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The extension does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your general browsing history</li>
        <li>GitHub passwords, access tokens, or cookies</li>
        <li>Private messages or comments outside of the current PR page</li>
        <li>Data from websites other than GitHub pull request pages</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How We Use This Information</h2>
      <p>
        When you log a pull request event, the extension sends the information
        listed above to our backend API over HTTPS using your API key. We use
        this data to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create and maintain a private log of your work activity</li>
        <li>Generate summaries that you can use for performance reviews or
          self‑reflection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data, and we do not share it with
        third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Storage & Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your API key is stored locally in your browser using Chrome’s storage
          mechanisms. You can remove or change it at any time from the
          extension options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data sent to our backend is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS
          connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          We take reasonable steps to protect stored data, but no method of
          transmission or storage is 100% secure.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Remote Code</h2>
      <p>
        The RapidReviewer Chrome extension does not execute any remotely hosted
        code. All executable code runs from the packaged extension. Network
        requests made by the extension are limited to JSON API calls to the
        RapidReviewer backend.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can uninstall the Chrome extension at any time from your browser’s
          extension settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can remove or change your API key from the extension options at
          any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you would like your account and associated data removed from our
          servers, you can contact us using the details below.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
        update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued
        use of the Service after any changes means you accept the updated
        policy.
      </p>
